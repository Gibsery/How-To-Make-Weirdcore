This is a guide on how to create weirdcore! Keep in mind that this is not a step-by-step guide, nor do you have to follow anything in this guide religiously (see what I did there?). It’s just a collection of tips and tricks that I use while making my images. If you have any other questions about how I achieved any effect, don’t be afraid to DM me or send an ask!

Before you read…
-Do not take anything in this guide too literally. These are recommendations, not rules! I absolutely encourage you to experiment and have fun while creating weirdcore.

-If you haven’t already, please read the weirdcore wiki page in order to gain a better understanding of what the aesthetic is.

How to make images look “dreamy” or “faded”
This will make your images appear dreamlike! I use this for nearly every edit I make. I will be using this image as an example. I tend to blur my images after I’ve added everything I want to the edit first. This ensures that everything in the edit is blurred and blends well.

First, I duplicate the image on another layer, then change the top layer to anywhere between 30-45% opacity.

Next, I Gaussian blur the top layer. I tend to blur between 2-7 pixels, but this can vary depending on the image quality. Your image should look somewhat like this afterwards. Don’t be afraid to play with layer opacity and blur amount!

Another optional blurring effect is using surface blur on the bottom layer. I tend to keep the radius and threshold quite low.

Next I adjust the image. Pro tip - you can add a layer mask on the top layer to only apply the adjustments to the top. This can result in very interesting effects!

To achieve the best dreamy effect, raise the brightness however much you see fit, lower the contrast, and raise the saturation.

This is what it looks like when adjustments are added to the entire image

And this is what it looks like when adjustments added only to the top layer

Finally, I merge the two layers and sharpen the image to add some definition.

How to add text (and make it look good!)
Most fonts work just fine with weirdcore images (yes, even Comic Sans). The vast majority of my edits use Arial.

In photoshop, press Ctrl + T or click Edit > Free Transform to enter transforming mode. Holding the control key and dragging a corner of the selected text box will perspective warp the text. This allows you to place text on walls, or anywhere else you want! (You might need to rasterize the text before perspective warping)

Right clicking on the text layer and selecting “blending options”. This allows you to change the properties of the text.

Transparent text can be achieved by making Fill Opacity at 0%. Then you can either bevel your text, add a glow or a shadow.

Bevel

Outer glow

Drop shadow

PERSONALLY, my favorite method of getting semi-transparent text is this: make your text white, turn the opacity down to 45% or lower, duplicate the layer, align the two text layers so that they are directly on top of each other, then gaussian blur the top layer. The end result should look something like this:
